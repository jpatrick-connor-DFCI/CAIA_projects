# COMPASS / IPIO Survival Analysis

Research workflow for assembling a prostate-cancer cohort from local DFCI / Profile / OncDRS
exports and running landmark survival analysis (Cox / XGBoost) on the resulting cohort.

The preprocessing and modeling code is pandas-based; publication figures are generated only in R.
Entry points are command-line scripts orchestrated from notebooks.
COMPASS uses one `COMPASS_run_locally.ipynb` notebook for two treatment-anchored cohort arms,
both drawn from an ADT-entry ICD-C61 cohort: `arpi` (anchored at first ARPI/chemo exposure) and
`adt` (anchored at first ADT exposure, years earlier in the treatment sequence). Patients with
bladder (C67), lung (C34), head-and-neck (C00-C14/C30-C32), or testicular (C62) cancer diagnosed
strictly after ADT start are excluded. The paired, R-only `COMPASS_generate_figures.ipynb` emits
manuscript figures for both.

## Repository structure

Only `COMPASS/`, `IPIO/`, `survival_common/`, and `data_preprocessing_common/` are tracked — see
`.gitignore` (`/*` is ignored except an allowlist). `common_OMOP/` exists on disk but is **not**
tracked.

## Stage 1 — Compile prostate cohort source data

`data_preprocessing/compile_COMPASS_cohort_data.py` (module-level script, argparse CLI for path
overrides). Derives the ICD-C61 universe, requires a dated ADT exposure as the primary entry
criterion, and excludes bladder (C67), lung (C34), head-and-neck (C00-C14/C30-C32), and
testicular (C62) cancer diagnosed strictly after first ADT. Other non-prostate primaries remain
descriptive only. The same eligible base cohort feeds the ARPI/chemo-anchored and ADT-anchored
survival data (age, treatment anchor, death, time-to-platinum), with `anchor_df`/`adt_anchor_df`
computed from the same medication scan.

- **Inputs (hard-coded under `DATA_PATH = /data/gusev/USERS/jpconnor/data/`, plus the raw OncDRS pull
  at `ONCDRS_PATH`):** `EHR_DIAGNOSIS.csv`, `HEALTH_HISTORY.csv`, `MEDICATIONS.csv`,
  `OUTPT_LAB_RESULTS_LABS.csv`, `complete_somatic_data_df.csv.gz`, `PT_INFO_STATUS_REGISTRATION.csv`.
- **Outputs (under `NEPC_PROJ_PATH = DATA_PATH/CAIA/COMPASS/`):** `prostate_arpi_survival_cohort_arpi.csv`
  and `prostate_adt_survival_cohort_adt.csv` (ARPI-treatment-anchor-restricted and
  ADT-treatment-anchor-restricted respectively), corresponding bare-MRN lists
  (`mrn_lists/arpi_mrns.csv`, `mrn_lists/adt_mrns.csv`), the ADT-entry-cohort
  platinum-recipient list (`mrn_lists/platinum_MRN_list.csv`), `prostate_icd_data.csv`, and
  `mrn_lists/icd_prostate_mrn_flags.csv`. The latter contains every ICD-C61 MRN plus binary
  indicators for a non-prostate primary (`HAS_NON_PROSTATE_PRIMARY`, descriptive only), a
  requested post-ADT cancer exclusion (`HAS_POST_ADT_EXCLUSION_CANCER`), PARPi exposure,
  ARPI/docetaxel exposure, ADT exposure (`ADT_EXPOSED`), and at least five broad PSA tests.
- **Cohort definition:** ICD-C61 plus dated ADT exposure, excluding the four specified cancer
  groups only when diagnosis is strictly after ADT start. The `adt` arm uses this cohort directly;
  the `arpi` arm additionally requires an ARPI/chemo anchor.
- **Anchor sets:** `ARPI_ANCHOR_MEDS` (7 drugs: ARPIs, taxanes, radium-223 — unchanged,
  `TREATMENT_ANCHOR_MEDS` alias retained) and `ADT_ANCHOR_MEDS` (10 drugs: GnRH agonists/antagonists
  + first-generation antiandrogens). `compute_treatment_anchor(meds, meds_set=...)` takes either set;
  `ANCHOR_MED_SETS = {"arpi": ..., "adt": ...}` maps the CLI-facing key to the drug set.

`compile_MRNs_for_manual_review.py` builds an auxiliary manual-review MRN sheet from the
stage-1 outputs (platinum records, non-prostate-primary ICDs, PARPi exposure, BRCA2 status).

---

## Stage 2 — Survival analysis

COMPASS survival analysis is PROFILE-only. Shared implementation details that are reused by
COMPASS PROFILE and IPIO live in `survival_common/`.

- **COMPASS PROFILE** — reads `longitudinal_prediction_data.csv` (ARPI anchor) or
  `longitudinal_prediction_data_adt.csv` (ADT anchor, via `--anchor-med-set adt`) and runs the
  prostate-cancer landmark analyses.
- **IPIO** — has its own cohort/outcome assembly but reuses the generic survival mechanics in
  `survival_common/`.

### 2.1 — `data_preprocessing/longitudinal_data_processing.py` → `longitudinal_prediction_data.csv`

Consolidates/standardizes labs and vital signs (via `data_preprocessing_common/dfci_labs.py`), attaches the first
prostate (`C61`) diagnosis date when available and outcomes, rebases all timing to
`FIRST_RECORD_DATE = min(first lab, diagnosis, first treatment)`, and writes the row-level
prostate lab frame used by the current treatment-anchored analyses.

- **Anchor selection:** `--anchor-med-set {arpi,adt}` (default `arpi`) selects `ARPI_ANCHOR_MEDS` or
  `ADT_ANCHOR_MEDS` (mirrored from Stage 1) and switches the defaults for `--survival-cohort-csv`,
  `--output-csv`, and `--consolidated-cache-parquet` to the ADT-suffixed files/cache when set to
  `adt`. Both anchors reuse the same lab-standardization code; only the anchor date and the derived
  timing columns differ.
- **Fast cohort scope:** by default, raw scans start from the anchored `arpi` cohort (or its ADT
  counterpart, under `--anchor-med-set adt`). PARPi-exposed patients and patients with fewer than
  five broad PSA records are removed before expensive lab standardization. Use
  `--prefilter-include-parpi`, `--prefilter-min-psa-count 0`, and/or a broader
  `--survival-cohort-csv` to rebuild a less restricted source frame.
- **Lab QC (`consolidate_dfci_labs`):** unit standardization to canonical units, sentinel nulling
  (e.g. `9999999`), physiologic-range nulling, combined-BP splitting. Out-of-range values are **nulled,
  not row-dropped** — downstream must filter on `conversion_status` (or pass `--successful-only`).
- **Vital signs included:** COMPASS scans `HEALTH_HISTORY.csv` for `CODE_TYPE = "Vital Signs"`,
  combines those records with outpatient labs before standardization, and retains the canonical
  vital measurements in model inputs and figures. Cache version 3 forces older no-vitals caches
  to rebuild.
- **Performance:** raw CSV scans project only required columns; lab consolidation is vectorized.
  Standardized rows are cached in `consolidated_longitudinal_data.parquet` (ARPI) or
  `consolidated_longitudinal_data_adt.parquet` (ADT) with a provenance manifest that includes
  `anchor_med_set`, so switching `--anchor-med-set` cannot silently serve a stale cache built under
  the other anchor. Use `--refresh-cache` to rebuild or `--no-cache` to bypass it. Large diagnostic
  CSVs are opt-in via `--write-unique-labs`, `--write-uncondensed`, and `--write-consolidated`.
- **Shared lab resources:** the canonical mapping lives at
  `data_preprocessing_common/resources/lab_mappings/OMOP_to_DFCI_lab_ids.csv`. The
  `unique_lab_ids_w_units.csv` inventory can be generated per project with
  `--write-unique-labs` for diagnostics or mapping refreshes; it is not a repo source of truth.
- **Timing semantics:** `t_lab`, `t_diagnosis`, `t_first_treatment`, `t_treatment_anchor`,
  `t_platinum`, `t_last_contact`, `t_death`. `t_death` is a real death-date-derived duration when the
  survival cohort's `death_date` is available (falls back to the last-contact proxy for dead patients
  with no recorded date); COMPASS models still use the `platinum` endpoint only.

### 2.2 — `data_preprocessing/build_prediction_inputs.py` → `prediction_inputs/`

The **single source of truth for model inputs**. It builds an independent eligible risk set at each
landmark and derives a separate train/valid/test split within each risk set. Day-0 membership therefore
does not require surviving event-free to day 90, avoiding an immortal-time restriction on the earlier
cohort.

- **Key CLI:** `--data`, `--landmark-days 0 90 180 365` (default from
  `cox_aggregated.DEFAULT_LANDMARK_DAYS`),
  `--seed`, `--test-frac`, `--val-frac`, `--time-unit-days 7`, `--min-patient-coverage`,
  `--auc-quantiles`, `--id-col`, `--age-col`, `--anchor-col`,
  `--restrict-to-mrns`, `--require-first-treatment` / `--no-require-first-treatment`,
  `--min-psa-count`, `--exclude-parpi` / `--include-parpi`.
- **Default downstream cohort filters:** `FIRST_TREATMENT == 1`, ≥5 PSA rows, and PARPi exclusion
  (when `PARPI_EXPOSED` is present). These defaults preserve the original first-treatment cohort, but
  alternate anchors can relax them explicitly.
- **Outputs:** `aggregated_landmark{D}.csv`, `pre_treatment_lab_long_landmark{D}.csv`,
  `split_assignments_landmark{D}.csv`, the base-landmark compatibility copy
  `split_assignments.csv`, `landmark_mrn_availability.csv`, `canonical_labs_train_val.csv`,
  `landmark_attrition.json`, and `build_manifest.json`.
- `IPIO/data_preprocessing/build_genomic_inputs.py` builds the parallel
  `prediction_inputs/genomic/` landmark-0 arm anchored at IO start (`t_first_treatment`), restricts
  to patients with an actual somatic sample, attaches dynamic binary `<GENE>_<SV|SNV|AMP|DEL>`
  indicators, and **reuses** the main `split_assignments.csv` so test stays test. It writes both
  genomic provenance files and runner-compatible aliases (`aggregated_landmark0.csv`,
  `pre_treatment_lab_long_landmark0.csv`, `canonical_labs_train_val.csv`, `build_manifest.json`).

### 2.3 — Models

All read prebuilt inputs and the `split` column; none re-derive the split. COMPASS models use the
`platinum` endpoint only (time to first platinum). Both ARPI- and ADT-anchored arms use landmarks
`[0, 90, 180, 365]`. Metrics: Harrell C-index, IPCW
mean AUC(t), integrated IPCW Brier — horizons come from `build_manifest.json` so all models share a
grid. The outer train+valid event-time quantiles define a bounded interval that is filled with up to
25 evenly spaced time points (interior quantiles are provenance only, not horizons). The builders clamp
that interval to stay strictly inside `--auc-max-time-units` and record the cap in the manifest, and the
runners evaluate with the manifest's cap by default, so no requested horizon is inestimable by
construction. Each evaluation
split records which requested points have cases, controls, and adequate follow-up; **AUC(t) and Brier
both pre-screen the timeline for their method-specific support requirements and use the same
administrative censoring cap**, since one horizon past a fold's follow-up can otherwise blank that
fold's entire metric. Mean AUC(t) and integrated Brier each require at least two valid points and 50%
timeline coverage; mean AUC(t) is always sksurv's censoring-weighted integral over the valid horizons,
never a substitute average. AUC first scores the eligible timeline in one batch and retries individual
horizons only if that batch fails. Metrics carry `train_val_*` / `test_*` prefixed AUC and Brier
requested/eligible/valid horizon counts, coverage, valid bounds, and status, in the same schema for Cox
and XGBoost.
Timeline schema version 3 is stored in the build manifest; model runners reject older manifests so
the input builder must be rerun after this change.

| Script | Model | CLI notes |
|---|---|---|
| `univariate_analysis.py` | Cox: univariate n_obs-adjusted associations | `--landmark-days`, `--endpoints`; IPIO also supports `--feature-subset {labs,genomics,all}` |
| `multivariate_analysis.py --model elastic-net` | Elastic-net Cox multivariable model (sksurv `CoxnetSurvivalAnalysis`, 5-fold CV, AGE unpenalized) | `--landmark-days`, `--endpoints`, `--n-folds`; IPIO also supports `--feature-subset {labs,genomics,all}` |
| `multivariate_analysis.py --model xgboost` | XGBoost `survival:cox`, 5-fold CV grid (`max_depth × eta × min_child_weight`) | `--landmark-days`, `--endpoints`, `--max-features`; IPIO also supports `--feature-subset {labs,genomics,all}` |

`cox_aggregated.py` is now a project adapter: endpoint constants, cohort-specific covariates/restrictions,
and per-landmark context. The univariate/elastic-net CLI orchestration lives in
`survival_common/cox_runners.py`; reusable Cox feature selection, CV, final-fit, and manifest helpers live in
`survival_common/cox_models.py`; low-level Cox fitting/evaluation primitives live in
`survival_common/cox_engine.py`; XGBoost orchestration lives in `survival_common/xgboost_runners.py`;
low-level XGBoost mechanics live in `survival_common/xgboost_engine.py`.

### 2.4 — Notebooks

COMPASS PROFILE has one run notebook, one figure notebook, and a focused
univariate-results review notebook:

- `COMPASS_run_locally.ipynb` — drives preprocessing and runs both `COHORT_SPECS` arms: `arpi`
  and `adt` (both landmarks 0/90), over the common ADT-entry eligible cohort.
  Each arm gets
  independent prediction inputs and univariate, elastic-net, and XGBoost models at its own landmark
  list (`tasks_for_run(run)` builds the per-run task grid from `run["landmarks"]`), and the Stage 2
  cell runs `longitudinal_data_processing.py` once per anchor (`--anchor-med-set {arpi,adt}`).
- `COMPASS_generate_figures.ipynb` — the sole COMPASS figure notebook, using the R kernel and
  `COMPASS_generate_figures_pipeline.R`. It renders both arms' overview, LLM-label, univariate,
  multivariate, KM, and per-lab distribution/trajectory figures at landmarks 0 and 90. Figure 1A reads
  `mrn_lists/icd_prostate_mrn_flags.csv` and displays cumulative ICD-C61 cohort selection through
  ADT entry, the requested post-ADT cancer exclusion, PARPi, and ≥5-PSA-test criteria; the ARPI
  arm additionally displays its ARPI/docetaxel exposure criterion. Axis and table labels throughout
  name the arm's anchor ("ARPI/chemo initiation" vs. "ADT initiation") via `ANCHOR_LABEL`.
  - **LLM label strata:** alongside the existing `LLM_v3_labels.tsv`-driven Figure 2, the pipeline
    loads `LLM_NEPC_classifier_labels.tsv` from
    `/data/gusev/USERS/jpconnor/data/LLM_annotations/LLM_NEPC_labels/` (`DFCI_MRN`, `primary_label`
    [conventional/avpc/nepc/biomarker], `has_nepc`, `has_avpc`, and a reported-biomarker field) via
    `load_llm_strata()`, re-deriving
    `is_platinum` from `mrn_lists/platinum_MRN_list.csv`. If the file is absent, all LLM-strata plots
    are skipped with a `message()` rather than failing. **Primary-label normalization:**
    `primary_label = biomarker` is retained only when the reported biomarkers contain a
    token-matched BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, or RB1. Otherwise the label falls back in order to
    NEPC when `has_nepc = 1`, AVPC when `has_avpc = 1`, and conventional. Rows whose category is
    missing, blank, `NaN`, `NA`, `null`, or `none` are removed from all classifier-derived LLM
    plots. This file drives:
    - **Figure 2 v2** (`ADT/figure2v2_llm/`, ADT cohort only) — a parallel confusion matrix / metric bar / subtype
      landscape / platinum-enrichment panel set (`figure2v2_confusion_matrix`,
      `figure2v2_metric_bar`, `figure2v2_confusion_has_nepc`, `figure2v2_confusion_has_avpc`,
      `figure2v2_subtype_landscape`, `figure2v2_enrichment`, `figure2v2_llm_subtype_platinum`),
      reusing the original Figure 2's render helpers. Unlike the original Figure 2, it has **no
      hardcoded `stopifnot` count assertions** — captions are computed dynamically after classifier
      labels are intersected with the complete ADT time-0 MRN set. Both Figure 2 and Figure 2v2 are
      ADT/day-0-only; the ARPI figure pass skips them, and captions report labeled/evaluable coverage
      against the total ADT day-0 cohort.
    - **All-lab longitudinal dynamics** — Figure 7's group-mean-CI trajectory machinery
      (`bin_group_ci()`/`plot_group_ci_panel()`) generalized from PSA/Testosterone-only to every
      canonical lab in `CATEGORY_MAP` (CBC/CMP/LFT/Vitals/Androgen/Other), stratified
      by platinum status plus `primary_label`/`has_nepc`/`has_avpc`. Stems:
      `longitudinal_<stratum>_<lab>`.
    - **All-lab KM-by-quartile** — Figure 5's Q1-vs-Q4 platinum-free KM curves, generalized the same
      way via `resolve_mean_col()`. Stems: `km_quartile_<lab>_landmark<D>`.
    - **All-lab distribution panels** — Figure 6's log/raw platinum-split distribution plots,
      generalized the same way. Stems: `dist_by_platinum_{log,raw}_<lab>_landmark<D>`.
      `PLOT_NON_ANDROGEN_DISTRIBUTIONS` controls whether distributions extend beyond PSA and
      Testosterone.
    - **Lab-panel toggles** — the figure notebook and pipeline defaults set both
      `PLOT_NON_ANDROGEN_DISTRIBUTIONS <- FALSE` and
      `PLOT_NON_ANDROGEN_LAB_FIGURES <- FALSE`. Lab-specific distribution, KM, and longitudinal
      panels are therefore limited to PSA and Testosterone. Non-androgen labs, including vitals,
      remain available to models and aggregate feature plots.
    - **LLM-stratified KM sanity check** — new time-to-platinum KM curves stratified by
      `primary_label`/`has_nepc`/`has_avpc`, using the same `platinum_km_inputs()` +
      `overlay_km()` path as the quartile curves. Stems: `km_llm_<scheme>_landmark<D>`.
  - **Output layout:** each arm has its own `FIG_ROOT/ARPI/` or `FIG_ROOT/ADT/` subtree. Non-lab
    figures use `<arm>/<figure>/<plot-stem>/<cohort>_<plot-stem>.png`; per-lab panels
    (longitudinal, km_quartile, distribution) use
    `<arm>/labs/<lab_category>/<lab_name>/<panel_type>/<cohort>_<stem>.png`. A lab-aware branch in
    `figure_group()` uses `assign_category()` for CBC/CMP/LFT/Vitals/Androgen axis/Other. Any
    plot stem `figure_group()` can't route still raises
    `stop("Unmapped figure output stem")`.
- `COMPASS_nominally_significant_univariate.ipynb` loads all shared-landmark univariate results
  for both `arpi` and `adt`, filters each to nominal `p_value < 0.05`, displays every hit, and exports
  a separate `cox/nominally_significant_univariate_results.csv` beneath each arm's run directory.

IPIO has a paired run/figure notebook as well:

- `IPIO_run_locally.ipynb` — builds standard lab landmark inputs at 0/90 plus the genomic landmark-0
  inputs, then runs univariate Cox, elastic-net Cox, and XGBoost for the lab arm, genomics-only arm,
  and genomics+labs arm separately.
- `IPIO_generate_figures.ipynb` — writes a labs-only paired volcano and a separate genomics-only
  volcano, plus the lab-arm discrimination, genomic-arm discrimination, and lab-arm importance
  figures.
---

## Conventions & invariants (preserve these when editing)

1. **Each landmark has its own risk set and split.** `build_prediction_inputs.py` writes the applicable
   split directly into each `aggregated_landmark{D}.csv` and also writes
   `split_assignments_landmark{D}.csv`. Models use the aggregated table's split and never re-split.
   `split_assignments.csv` remains a base-landmark compatibility copy for `build_genomic_inputs.py`.
2. **Fit on the training block; never touch test for fitting.** Imputers, `StandardScaler`,
   canonical-lab selection, and Breslow baselines are all fit on train+valid (or fold-train inside CV) and
   applied to eval. Per-fold canonical labs are recomputed inside CV. The leakage guards
   `assert_no_test_leakage` / `assert_disjoint_folds` live in `survival_common/helper.py`.
3. **Canonical labs and horizon grids are training-block artifacts.** The main canonical lab set and
   AUC/Brier horizons are derived on **train+valid**; CV recomputes canonical labs on each fold-train.
   Evaluation data may only mask requested horizons that are not estimable—it never supplies
   replacement times. Do not derive the requested timeline from held-out test patients.
4. **Endpoint and duration:** COMPASS uses `(t_platinum, PLATINUM)` only. For non-platinum patients,
   the anchor time is filled with `t_last_contact` (censoring). After landmark rebasing, the validity
   filter requires duration `> 0`, which silently drops patients with platinum before/at the landmark —
   add count logging if you depend on it.
5. **ID/age columns are injected at runtime.** PROFILE defaults to `DFCI_MRN` / `AGE_AT_TREATMENTSTART`;
   IPIO defaults to `DFCI_MRN` with its own baseline covariates. `build_*` and model `main()` functions
   mutate module globals **and monkey-patch `cox_aggregated.ID_COL/AGE_COL`**. If you add a function that captures
   `ID_COL` at import time (default arg, module constant), it will not see the patch — thread the column
   through as a parameter instead.
6. **Horizon grid is shared via `build_manifest.json`** so Cox/XGBoost AUC & Brier are comparable.
   Don't compute horizons ad hoc in a model script.

## Configuration & paths

- **Hard-coded cluster roots** (all overridable by CLI except module-level constants):
  - Data: `/data/gusev/USERS/jpconnor/data/CAIA/COMPASS/`
  - Survival results: `/data/gusev/USERS/jpconnor/data/CAIA/COMPASS/survival_analysis`
  - Figures: `/data/gusev/USERS/jpconnor/figures/CAIA/COMPASS/`
- `data_preprocessing_common/dfci_labs.py` uses the checked-in shared
  `resources/lab_mappings/OMOP_to_DFCI_lab_ids.csv` by default. Per-project lab inventory outputs
  default to `/data/gusev/USERS/jpconnor/data/CAIA/<project>/unique_lab_ids_w_units.csv`.

## Dependencies

No packaged environment is checked in. Assumed: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `tqdm`, `scikit-learn`,
`scikit-survival` (`sksurv`), `xgboost`, `lifelines`, `matplotlib`. Python **3.10+** is recommended
for the modern type-hint syntax used by the shared modules.

## Known issues / footguns

These are real, verified items found in code review. Fix opportunistically; at minimum, don't be
surprised by them.

### Medium impact

- **`auc_max_time_units = 260` is the default** (`DEFAULT_AUC_MAX_TIME_UNITS` in `survival_common/helper.py`)
  and admin-censors AUC/Brier unless `--auc-max-time-units` is overridden. The builders clamp the horizon
  grid to it and runners read it back from the manifest; overriding it at run time only (not at build
  time) makes the two diverge, which the runner warns about.
- **Silent patient drops** at several inner-joins and `valid`-mask filters (diagnosis/death inner joins,
  duration `> 0` filter). Downstream cohort filters now log attrition in `build_prediction_inputs.py`;
  keep that pattern for any new cohort-selection rule.

### Low impact / cleanliness

- `iterrows`/`apply`-based row loops in `data_preprocessing_common/dfci_labs.py` and `longitudinal_data_processing.py`
  are slow on full DFCI-scale pulls — vectorize if performance bites.

## Notes

- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` and `__pycache__/` artifacts are git-ignored and not part of the workflow.
- Several scripts read and write data **outside** the repository root (the `/data/gusev/...` cluster paths).
